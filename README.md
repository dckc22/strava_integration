Strava Integration

## What:

This repo is used for pulling my Strava activities and playing around with the data, by activity type.


## Why:

I enjoy looking at prior training data by activity (run/bike), and analyzing my pace/speed, cadence, heart rate, etc.


## Credit:

The code used to pull my activities using the Strava API is largely the same as what was done here: https://medium.com/swlh/using-python-to-connect-to-stravas-api-and-analyse-your-activities-dummies-guide-5f49727aac86
